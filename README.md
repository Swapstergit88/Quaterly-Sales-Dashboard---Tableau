## **Quarterly Sales Dashboard**

---

## Overview
The **Quarterly Sales Dashboard** is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to deliver comprehensive insights into quarterly sales performance across various countries and product subcategories. This dashboard serves as a vital tool for stakeholders, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning by addressing key challenges faced in sales analysis.

### Challenges Addressed
1. **Lack of Comprehensive Insights**: Stakeholders often struggle to obtain a holistic view of sales performance across different regions and product lines. This dashboard consolidates critical data, allowing users to assess performance at a glance.
  
2. **Inefficient Data Analysis**: Manual analysis of quarterly sales data can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The dashboard automates this process, providing real-time visualizations that highlight trends and patterns effectively.

3. **Difficulty in Identifying Trends**: Without proper visualization tools, recognizing sales trends over time can be challenging. The dashboard features dynamic charts that illustrate quarterly trends, making it easier to identify high and low sales periods.

4. **Limited Ability to Filter Data**: Stakeholders require the ability to drill down into specific data segments for thorough analysis. The dynamic filtering options allow users to focus on particular quarters, countries, and subcategories, enhancing the analytical experience.

## Components

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- *France:* $919K
- *Germany:* $829K
- *Italy:* $192K
- *USA:* $904K

These KPIs provide immediate insights into the sales performance of key markets.

### 2. Dynamic Filters
- **Select Quarter:** Filter data by specific quarters ranging from Q1 2018 to Q4 2022.
- **Select Country:** Filter data by selecting one or multiple countries.

These filters enhance user engagement and allow for tailored analyses based on user needs.

### 3. Sparklines
Located below the KPIs, sparkline charts showcase quarterly sales trends for each country, highlighting significant fluctuations in sales performance.

### 4. Bubble Chart
The bubble chart visualizes sales and profit data for various subcategories. Each bubble represents a subcategory, with size indicating sales volume and color representing profit margins.

### 5. Dual-Line Chart
This chart illustrates both sales and profit trends over time, with solid lines representing sales and dashed lines representing profit. This dual representation allows stakeholders to observe correlations between sales volumes and profitability effectively.

## Interactivity
